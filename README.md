**Git** is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, managing changes through a system of branches and commits.

Key features include:

* **Version tracking**: Keeps a history of code changes.
* **Branching and merging**: Enables experimentation without affecting the main codebase.
* **Distributed architecture**: Each user has a full copy of the repository.

Git is widely used in both open-source and commercial projects, often in conjunction with platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**.
